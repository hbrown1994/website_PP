              Technical Reserve: Cheap Heat

                Bray Wyatt: "I don't like to think of myself as just a person. I don't think I am. I think I existed before, and I think I'll exist again after I die here, so I don't exactly know what I am..."

                <br>
                <br>

                It's never been entirely clear what wrestling actually is. Is it a sport? Theater? Performance art? Or some complex form that is always actually emerging? What we can say for sure: wrestling, ultimately, is about reception.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                "As a pro-wrestler, there are a few ways that you can get the crowd invested in what you do. You can dazzle them with your incredible acrobatics, brutalize your opponent with anything at hand, project the aura of an unstoppable badass, work to tell a story through your matches, or even develop your character through interviews and promo segments. Or, you can take the easy way out and get some Cheap Heat."
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Performers and their audience; the audience and their performers. Cheap Heat is a direct appeal.
